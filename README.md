I take no credit for the code, i simply edited it to fit my server

## My Edit Features:
- Vehicle License plate to "GOPOSTAL"
- Changed pay outcome to match my city
- Removed qb-cityhall stuff as i dont use in my city
## Features:
- **Framework Compatibility**: Whether you're running on QB or ESX, this script has got you covered.
- **Targeting Systems**: Enhanced gameplay with full support for `ox_target` & `qb-target`.
- **Notification Systems**: Get notified whether you use QB, ESX, okok, or mythic.

#### To Whitelist the job`:
1. In config.lua make `Config.IS_WHITELISTED_TO_JOB` true.
2. In config.lua change `Config.WHITELISTED_JOB_TITLE` to job string of desired. We have it as `postal` by default.
3. Add the following snippet to `qb-core/shared/jobs.lua`
```lua
    ['postal'] = {
        label = 'GoPostal',
        defaultDuty = true,
        offDutyPay = false,
        grades = {
            [0] = {
                name = 'Delivery Driver',
                payment = 10,
                isboss = false,
            },
            [1] = {
                name = 'Manager',
                isboss = true,
                payment = 12
            },
            [2] = {
                name = 'Boss',
                isboss = true,
                payment = 15
            },
        }
    },
```
