#### To Whitelist the job`:

3. Add the following snippet to `qb-core/shared/jobs.lua`
```lua
    ['postal'] = {
        label = 'GoPostal',
        defaultDuty = false,
        offDutyPay = false,
        grades = {
            [0] = {
                name = 'Delivery Driver',
                payment = 0,
                isboss = false,
            },
            [1] = {
                name = 'Manager',
                isboss = true,
                payment = 0
            },
            [2] = {
                name = 'Boss',
                isboss = true,
                payment = 0
            },
